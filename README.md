## Purpose  
This project is a web-based YouTube playlist shuffler. It takes in a playlist URL and prompts the user for ways they would want to shuffle the contents of that playlist. Uses the YouTube Data API v3 to retrieve information about the playlist and then uses custom and Bootstrap CSS for formatting.

## Features 
Custom shuffling of YouTube playlists.

## Technologies-Used  
Currently made with JavaScript and HTML5/CSS.

## Installation  
There is no need to install this application for use, because it is hosted at the links provided above. However, for code inspection or etc, if you have SSH Keys linked, you can simple use your terminal and clone the repo down, otherwise, the typical zip.

## Usage  
By using the YouTube Data API v3 to retrieve information about the playlist, we are able to get any playlist the user has access to and create a shuffled version.
